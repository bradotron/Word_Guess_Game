# Word_Guess_Game
A simple guessing game that mimics the gameplay of the classic word guessing games. The user uses the keyboard to type a letter, then the game will let the user know if the guess was correct or incorrect. 

As the user makes guesses, the user will lose one life for each incorrect guess until the user either completes the word or runs out of lives. If the user completes the word, the user gets 1 win and can get another word to guess. On a loss, the wins counter is reset and the user gets a new word.
